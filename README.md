<h4>To Run this code:</h4>
You will need to run
```
    pip install matplotlib scipy numpy
```
in your python terminal. That should be it...

I think with the report we will be turning in a .zip that will have a .venv already included (maybe)
The exact data that we collected is in results-thermo-project.xlsx

Also important to note is that every script is going to output pictures to the root directory of the project.
There is also a bug with MatPlotLib right now, when it opens the GIF of the phase diagram and GX curves along with the GX curves at specific temperatures, the code will hang unless you close the GIF window before closing the image of the GX curve.
